** Transcription of the letter:**

> I'<b>m</b> not as scared as a I used to be. Their mystery b<b>e</b>gins to fade as a method to defeat them becomes more clea<b>r</b>. I no longer feel powerless. I can o<b>u</b>tsmart them. This new power of psychokinesis w<b>o</b>rked, and I believe it can work again. I stand here, look<b>i</b>ng down at the line where the water m<b>e</b>ets the sand - a starting line. All the while, k<b>n</b>owing there is a finish Iine across the Strait. Their com<b>p</b>ass lies, but mine remains true. I've l<b>e</b>ft embers of inspiration, I only hope whatever s<b>p</b>ark was left has grown to a torch, and together we create <b>a</b>n inferno. [SIGNED] – Clancy
