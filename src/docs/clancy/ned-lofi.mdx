## 11/23/2023 - Ned's Cozy Fireplace 

On November 23 2023, the band released a 10 hour video of relaxing tunes. This video features Ned sitting by a fireplace while lofi versions of twenty one pilots song play.

In the background, a bookshelf can be seen. On one of the shelves, books are arranged in a 229 pattern - two books, a gap, two books, another gap, and nine books. This hinted towards the band's return on the 29th of February (2/29), where the single Overcompensate was released.

On one of the walls, a few notes taped to the wall can be seen -  a sketch of the sai symbol, a sketch of the neon gravestones, a tree,  and a note from Ned.
