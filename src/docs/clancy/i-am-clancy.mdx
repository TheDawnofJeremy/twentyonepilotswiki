## 02/22/2024 - I am Clancy

On the 22th of February, the band posted a video on Youtube. 

<iframe width="640" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ozlHHR_eSxc" title="I Am Clancy" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**Additional information:**
- In the background, a lo-fi version of "The Outside" from Ned's Cozy Fireplace is playing.
- This video gives additional context to the "[Saturday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiXVRdotCEk)" music video in which Trash the Dragon crashes into the submarine where Tyler is performing a show, as well as "[The Outside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNcvblM8-_o)" music video, where Keons gets stabbed by the other bishops. It is now confirmed that Keons betrayed Nico by seizing Trash in an attempt to free Tyler from the submarine. 
- We also receive a confirmation that the "[Heavydirtysoul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_9Kf0D5BTs)" music video features Tyler escaping *from* DEMA - first by tricking Nico into taking him outside and then 'creating a diversion'. 
- At the end of the video, a voice speaking German can be heard:
*"Diese kleine unheimliche Insel hat mich zu einer Waffe gemacht. Wir glauben beide-â€œ*
 This is a translated excerpt from the fourth handwritten [Clancy note](./scaledandicy/03-18-22-2.mdx) posted on March 22nd, 2022, and can also be heard in the beginning of the single "Overcompensate" that would be released a week later.


** Transcription of the video:**
  > I am trapped.
>
  >Stuck in a cycle I have never been able to break.
>
  >I want to believe this is the last time, but
  I don't know for sure.
>
  >I'll start with what I do know. I am a citizen of an old city.
>
  >Well, they say it's old, but there's just no proof.
>
 > I can feel my friends rolling their eyes.
>
 > I'll keep it simple.
  I am a citizen of Dema,
  a circular cement city in the lower portion
  of an otherwise wild and green continent, Trench.
>
 > We aren't allowed to go out there.
>
  >Most haven't even seen it. But I have.
>
 > I am an escapee.
>
 > Getting better at it with every attempt.
  But they always find me.
  Well, he does.
  Nico.
>
  >Or, Blurryface is what he calls himself.
  He's the leader of the nine Bishops
  who govern the city.
>
  >Their authority comes from two things:
  a miraculous power and a hijacked religion.
>
  One feeds the other.
  A cycle.
>
  >It's called Vialism.
  And all you really need to know
  is that it teaches that self-destruction
  is the only way to paradise.
  It also conveniently allows you
  to become an available vessel for the Bishops to use.
>
  >And that's where the miracle comes in.
  We call it seizing.
  The rules are
  that you can only seize, or control, a dead body
  and only for a short while.
>
  >Also, they, the Bishops,
  are the only ones who can do it.
>
  >I am a citizen.
  I am an escapee.
  And I am an exception to the rule.
>
  >Okay, this is what happened recently.
>
  >I tricked Nico into taking me outside the walls.
  I created a fiery diversion.
  I escaped.
  I wandered,
  grew weak,
  and was tracked down.
>
  >But this drag path was different.
  I saw them. They watched me. The Banditos.
>
  >Legends, only stories of a group that lived out here.
  Shortly after being back inside the walls
  my new people got me out.
>
  >They needed me for something.
  They brought me in, taught me their colors.
>
  >But the cycle was too strong.
  I was recaptured. Back inside.
  I guess word got around, I became known in Dema.
>
  >The Bishops did not like this,
  but decided to use it to their advantage.
>
  >They made me entertain the people.
  Lie to them.
  They made me perform for them.
  Then Nico was betrayed.
  And I escaped.
  Again.
>
  >This time
  I found myself at a new place, washed up on an island.
  And there, I was given a gift,
  thought to be extinct.
>
  >I now had the same exact, miraculous power
  they wielded from their towers.
>
  >I am a citizen.
  I am an escapee.
  I am an exception.
  I am returning to Trench.
