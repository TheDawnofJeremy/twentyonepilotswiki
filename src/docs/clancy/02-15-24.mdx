On February 15th, people started receiving mysterious red envelopes. The envelope had a stamp with the logo of the Sacred Municipality of DEMA, United Vialists, and the violation code. Inside, a document called Evidence was included, together with another printed letter, and a letter from Clancy. Lastly, a map of Trench was included.[^1]

** Additional Info:**
- The footnote under the letter says "*take excessive measures in attempting to correct or make amends for an error, weakness, or problem*". This is the definition of the word Overcompensate, which was later revealed to be the title of the first single of the upcoming album.
- The number in the top right corner shows that 1500 letters were sent out. Each letter had its number written out by hand.


** Transcription of the letter:**
> YOU HAVE RECENTLY ACCESSED INTERNAL DOCUMENTS PERTAINING TO CASE 15390642_14: [DELINQUENT] CLANCY VS. THE SACRED MUNICIPALITY OF DEMA.
 IN THIS ONGOING INVESTIGATION, WE ARE URGING ANYONE WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE ACCUSED TO COME FORWARD WITH RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE CASE. IT IS REQUIRED THAT ALL INHABITANTS OF DEMA TO DO THEIR DUTY* IN BRINGING ALL ENEMIES OF VIALISM AND ITS TEACHINGS TO SWIFT JUSTICE

> -THE HONORABLE BISHOPS OF THE SACRED MUNICIPALITY OF DEMA.

## Evidence letter

[![Alt text: Scan of an official looking letter from DEMA printed in red. Big red letters on top spelling 'EVIDENCE'. Handwritten text across the letter. ](./assets/physical2.jpeg)](./assets/physical2.jpeg)

** Additional Info:**
- The doubled letters spell out 'Still alive'. This suggests that, contrary to [the messages we have received previously](./scaledandicy/clancy-is-dead.mdx), Clancy is not dead.
- Handwritten text over the page says "*How did you find http://dmaorg<span>.</span>info/found/15398642_14/clancy.html???*". This is the link to the original dmaorg website where all other letters from Clancy have been published.

** Transcription of the letter:**

## Map of Trench

** Additional Info:**
- A new location, Paladin Strait, has been added to the map
- Keon's tower on the DEMA map now appears to be empty

## 024 02MOON09 / Clancy letter

[![Alt text: Scan of typed journal page. Printed out signature signing 'Clancy' at bottom.](./assets/physical4.jpeg)](./assets/physical4.jpeg)



** Additional Info:**
- This letter was later published on dmaorg.info 
- When looking at the bolded letters, we can see that they follow a 2-2-9 pattern. For example, m in 'I'm' is the second letter from the left, the e in 'begins' is also the second letter from the left, etc. When converted into a date, the numbers hint to February 29th. This was the day when the single Overcompensate was released.
- As far as is known, the letters themselves (meruoienpepa) do not have any significance


** Transcription of the letter:**

> I'<b>m</b> not as scared as a I used to be. Their mystery b<b>e</b>gins to fade as a method to defeat them becomes more clea<b>r</b>. I no longer feel powerless. I can o<b>u</b>tsmart them. This new power of psychokinesis w<b>o</b>rked, and I believe it can work again. I stand here, look<b>i</b>ng down at the line where the water m<b>e</b>ets the sand - a starting line. All the while, k<b>n</b>owing there is a finish Iine across the Strait. Their com<b>p</b>ass lies, but mine remains true. I've l<b>e</b>ft embers of inspiration, I only hope whatever s<b>p</b>ark was left has grown to a torch, and together we create <b>a</b>n inferno. [SIGNED] â€“ Clancy
