## 018 07MOON 05 - Day of the update

[![Alt text: halftone image of a landscape on a white background. A small silhouette of the city of Dema can be seen far off in the distance.](./assets/_o__ut_.png)](./assets/_o__ut_.png)

**File name:**  _o__ut_.gif

**Additional Info:**

- The picture shows a relatively flat structure in the distance, close to the left border before the incline, with a centerpiece protruding from its silhouette. It is later revealed at the beginning of the "[Nico and the Niners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMAPyGoqQVw)" music video that this is a silhouette of Dema.
- The file name implies that this is Clancy's point of view, finally looking back at Dema after he has escaped from the city.

[![Alt text: This note appears to be inverted and is white text on a black background. The text is typed and at the bottom is the signature of clancy. There are several small white squares at the bottom left and top right of the page.](./assets/he_a_vy.jpg)](./assets/he_a_vy.jpg)

**File name:** he_a_vy.jpg

**Additional info:**

- Unlike the other journals, this one features a black background with white text. 
- Nine pairs of white squares point to six different letters vertically placed above or below the squares in the journal (the number of squares specify the number of lines to count up/down into the paragraph). The letters spell the message “WAKE UP.”

**Transcription of the journal:**

> They're asleep. The night took forever to arrive, and now we're almost ready. We've studied the watchers, and know that there's no chance that we can step through unnoticed. So, instead of trying to hide ourselves, we'll make sure that all of us are  noticed. It's been one year since the last convocation, and tomorrow's Annual Assemblage of Glorified will be the biggest spectacle this concrete coffin of a city has seen all year. If we time it right, we'll divert the attention of the watchers and finally take the step through. We've had no contact, but we're hoping the other side will be able to find a way in. We're not sure of the breach location, but we are willing to risk being smeared in order to find it. We know that we must go lower, and wait for the torches. They've never seen anything quite like this, and by morning, everything will be different. I'm terrified and excited, all at the same time. They don't control us.
