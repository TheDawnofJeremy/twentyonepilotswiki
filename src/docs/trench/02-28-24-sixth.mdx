**Transcription of the letter:**

> These camp<b>f</b>ires feel like h<b>o</b>me, as I stare deep<b>l</b>y into them, finding more and more c<b>l</b>arity. They tried to tell us we were different. But the flame that burns inside <b>o</b>f me is the same fire I've found on the hilltops of Trench. The Banditos have lived their rebellion, and a resistance is gro<b>w</b>ing inside <b>the</b> concre<b>t</b>e walls-<b>o</b>ne powe<b>r</b>ful enough to burn out all of the stale tea<b>ch</b>ings, and ush<b>e</b>r in true hope-and a path to actual life. We march in the morning. The revolution <b>s</b>hall arrive with the sun.
