**File name:**  __cla_im00FFFF.jpeg

**Additional Info:**
- There is no signature on the bottom of the letter
- The bold letters spell out “fly out”, a lyric from the song Overcompensate that was released a day after the update
- The file name, __cla_im00FFFF.jpeg, includes a hex code for the colour cyan. The name then spells ‘claim cyan’, an anagram for I am clancy


**Transcription of the letter:**

> I <b>found</b> a way in. A way they'll never suspect, and a way they'l<b>l</b> never understand. Everything about our cause is so hard for them to understand, but so close to the hearts of the glowing resistance. I can reach them all. I can recruit ever<b>y</b>one with eyes that see beyond the horizon. I can teach them. They can learn what I've learned, and fly <b>by</b> all of the constructs Dema has placed in front of them. We will take it back.
