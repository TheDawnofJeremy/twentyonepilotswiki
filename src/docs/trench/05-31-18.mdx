[![Alt text: Black and white gif of cheetah running. At the top are rapidly flashing letters.](./assets/3lurr.gif)](./assets/3lurr.gif)

**File name:** 3lurr.gif

**Additional Info:**

- The gif is a black-and-white stabilized snippet of a cheetah running. Each individual frame of the gif flashes a letter on top of it.
- The full message says "U STILL DONT KNOW HIS REAL NAME DO U?" along with the letters “NICONICO” in each of the spaces between the words -- UNSTILLIDONTCKNOWOHISNREALINAMECDOOU?
- This is a reference to Nico, the only bishop whose name didn’t correlate to his corresponding song in Blurryface, “Stressed Out.”
- The scene is from the movie Duma (2005).
