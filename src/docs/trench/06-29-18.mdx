## 017 07MOON 17
[![Alt text: Half tone image on white background showing a group of people standing at the top of a cliff. Perspective of the shot is like someone at the bottom of the cliff looking up at them. Same setting as the Jumpsuit music video.](./assets/2018_514_3_8.jpg)](./assets/2018_514_3_8.jpg)

**File name:** 2018_514_3_8.jpg

**Additional Info:**

- The MOON date (July 17th, 2017) is the actual day of the 2017 APMAs, in which Josh received the award for Most Dedicated Fanbase and said Tyler was off "severing ties with DEMA".
- The picture has the following caption below it: **__n_ot_myo_nly_fri_en d**
- The file name (2018_514_3_8) translates to "tr_en_c_h" (1 = A, 2 = B, etc.)
- If you replace the violation code in the URL with “2018_514_3_8”, you can access a new subdomain: [http://dmaorg.info/found/2018_514_3_8/clancy.html](https://www.dmaorg.site/062918/found/2018_514_3_8/clancy.html). It features an 8-second audio file with a distorted voice, which can be edited in order to hear Tyler’s voice. The subdomain is also accessible through [http://dmaorg.info/found/trench/clancy.html](https://www.dmaorg.site/062918/found/trench/clancy.html).
- In a later update, it was revealed that the voice says “We are banditos”, but reversed. The same reversed phrase from the audio is used on the Trench song "Nico and the Niners" at 3:31 - 3:34.
- If you overlay this image with the vulture picture ("unnamed (1)"), the positions of each figure match up pretty closely with the vultures, as if there was an attempt to recreate it.
