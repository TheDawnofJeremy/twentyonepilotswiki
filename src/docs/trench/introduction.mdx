## What is dmaorg.info?

[dmaorg.info](http://dmaorg.info) is a website domain officially created and hosted by the band Twenty One Pilots and used mainly as an online conceptual teaser for their 2018 album "TRENCH". It featured a cryptic background story and important lore information referenced in the songs and music videos of the TRENCH era.

The domain was first discovered by the fanbase on 4/21/2018, during the band’s hiatus between Blurryface and Trench through a link hidden inside the Twenty One Pilots’ official merch store website. The original link led to an exclusive 404 error page, telling the viewer “they’re in violation” and “no one should know about this” while showing a violation code.

When pasted correctly into the URL of the website, the violation code granted access to [another page](https://www.dmaorg.site/original/found/15398642_14/clancy.html) of dmaorg.info containing journals and images telling the story of Clancy, an afflicted fictional character living inside a circular city loomed by huge walls and ruled by nine bishops – the Sacred Municipality of Dema.

As the website updated throughout the months and more content was added to its lore, Clancy’s struggles with Dema became visible and a plan to escape the city came true. But after getting lost in the unknown wilderness of Trench, Clancy grew weary and anxious, ending up being retrieved back to Dema by his bishop Keons and temporarily ending the timeline of dmaorg.info.

On 4/2/2021, the website updated to show a progress bar that would result in the site being terminated, and a complete inversion of colors. On 4/5/2021, all files in the subdomain were deleted and the website showed up an “Account Terminated” message instead, showing that the Dema Council had found and overtaken the site, while also hiding some images teasing the next era of the band's projects.  

After almost a year of silence, on 3/16/2022, the site updated with a new map of the continent of Trench which introduced the island of Voldsøy-Norwegian word for violence island. With this map, we saw the return of Clancy and the Torchbearer after they washed up on the island. Throughout a couple of days, Clancy lamented about his struggles back in captivity in the city, and formulated his plan to take down the bishops, eventually finding a way to succeed. On March 18th, 2022, he discovered a new method of control called "psychokinesis". He then created a weapon using the gifts of some curious little creatures on Voldsøy, affectionately identified as "Ned" (Neuro Expansion Device)

On 2/13/2024, 1500 red letters were sent out to the public by the Sacred Municipality of Dema containing evidence seemingly seized from Clancy's belongings. It included a new letter from Clancy, where he talked about having renewed hope in his plan, an updated map showing the new Paladin Strait between Voldsøy and the mainland of Trench, and a request for information on Clancy's whereabouts from the Bishops of Dema. Both letters included hidden messages, but handwritten was a question. "How did you find http://dmaorg.info/found/15398642_14/clancy.html?"
