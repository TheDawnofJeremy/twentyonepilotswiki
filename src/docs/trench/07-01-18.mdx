**File name:** _e_sr__eve_r_.jpg

**Additional Info:**

- The lines from this journal were stripped out and put together to spell a hidden message, visible only with the yellow tape image available in this current update.
- The yellow tape highlights the message “WE ARE BANDITOS” vertically, in reference to the audio file found in [http://dmaorg.info/found/2018_514_3_8/clancy.html](https://www.dmaorg.site/062918/found/2018_514_3_8/clancy.html). As the file name suggests, you need to “reverse” the audio to hear the message.

 ![A lifeless light surrounds us each night. Never could I imagine that something so luminous could feel so dark. It's this glow that reminds us of the dreamless existence we've been sentenced to. But what I call a sentence, others accept as normalcy. How did they so efficiently eradicate the dreams within us? When the bishops instituted Vialism as mandate, they effectively reversed the hope that many arrived with. Am I the only one who realizes that we've been lied to? Am I the only one not afraid of the notion that the nine have hijacked our trust, and extinguished the hope that once motivated our existence? We used to close our eyes and picture a better life, now this city is full of dry eyes caught in a trance of obedience, devoid of any trace of an identity. The only significant light I've seen has been in the eyes of those smeared - such a curious sight, to see bright eyes strangled by the darkness of bishop hands. As their penance fades, so dims their memory of something more. My hope of something more is all I have in this rigid tomb, and I will not let it die](./assets/alttext.png)

**File name:** _.jpg

**Additional info:**

- The MOON date (Feburary 12th, 2017) is the day “Stressed Out” won the Grammy for "[Best Pop Duo/Group Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxBERcE5yl8)".
- The yellow tapes highlight the message “WE ARE BANDITOS” once you overlay the image over the Clancy journal of this current update:

&emsp;&emsp;[![Alt text: The image of the tape overlaid on the scan of the journal entry.](./assets/_withnote.png)](./assets/_withnote.png)

- Six numbers are also visible in the image. When reordered, they spell the violation code on the Trench page: 20-18-5-14-3-8.
- The letters “E N D” are circled in yellow.
- Although added as part of the same update as the third journal, this image is the first to be placed between older images on the main dmaorg website, positioned between the map (" _ti_su_p") and the second journal ("017_07MOON_07"). This placement maintains the chronological order of the MOON dates.
