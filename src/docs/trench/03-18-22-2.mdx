## 022 03MOON 18 - Day of the update

[![Alt text: Scan of long handwritten note on a distressed piece of paper. Note is written in cursive and is signed by Clancy at the bottom.](./assets/1619250308151109140519-Ø-919.jpg)](./assets/1619250308151109140519-Ø-919.jpg)

**File name:** 1619250308151109140519-Ø-919.jpg

**Additional Info:**

- The numbers in the file name (1619250308151109140519919) translate to "psychokinesis" (1 = A, 2 = B, etc.). 
- The letter explains the act of psychokinesis where the bishops (and Clancy) are able to seize a dead body for a limited period of time. This is the process that was shown on the diagram on the previous update.
- The beginning of the last paragraph (*'This small eerie island has made me a weapon...'*) is later referenced to in the I am Clancy video, as well as in the song Overcompensate. 

**Transcription of the letter:**

> What is this thing? This device? This gift? Some sort of neurological connection or expansion. Psychokinetic weapon?
> 
> This is absurd.
> 
> Why was this given to me? Why am I the only one that can weild it? Was this the reason that I survived? My mind is racing as I wait here on the rocks -- staring off into the darkness. Waiting for our torches to be mirrored - the signal he told me to wait for.
> 
> It feels oddly familiar. Not the spikes in my hand, but the power it harnesses, I've felt it before. Is this also the source of those rumors I heard in the dark corners of the city? Legends and stories that I assumed were myth, inspired by children's nightmares -- tales of what the bishops would use the bodies for. Those "honorable" citizens who acheived The Glorious Gone -- referred to as available vessels.
> 
> It all begins to make sense.
> 
> The episodes I would have: the blood red vision, my dreams of flying, the out of body account of the rider in the river, the decaying hosts of the television show, the robed figures that commanded the doomed ship...
> 
> Had we all been "seized" by the bishops using this same technique? Is this where their power comes from? Are they immortal, or just feeding off the next body, giving their hosts a brief second-life? I am in my original life, why am I available to this control?
> 
> This whole time I thought I was battling my inner self. Was I actually under assault for something else? someONE else?
> 
> This small eerie island has made me a weapon. We both believe that we can use it to change the momentum of this war. Now, we must return to the mainland where they should be there to recieve is. We will destroy and rebuild. Though it's been years since he last spoke with them, I hope they have not lost faith in The Torchbearers plan.
> 
> But how could any of this have been planned?
> 
> \- Clancy
