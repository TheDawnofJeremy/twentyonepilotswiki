**File name:** _they_ca_ntseeFCE300.gif

**Additional Info:**

- “FCE300” is the hexadecimal code for a specific shade of yellow. The file name, along with the previous journal, suggests that the bishops or the “watchers” are unable to see this color.

- Trivia: The day of this update marks the one-year anniversary of the band's hiatus.
