## 04/20/2018 - Vessel gif changed

On April 20th, 2018, the original [gif/video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IigZXFhkbMM) used on the Vessel tab of the Twenty One Pilots store website was replaced with one containing an incomplete link: https://dmaorg.info/found/||l_./clancy.html. 

[![Alt text: Gif with various scenes from Vessel music videos and behind the scenes videos, including Holding On To You, House of Gold, and Car Radio. Clip at end of gif shows tv screen from Car Radio music video with a link hidden in the TV static/ glitch.](./assets/vesselstorepage.gif)](./assets/vesselstorepage.gif)


## 04/21/2018 - Vessel gif discovered

The Vessel gif with the mysterious link was first discovered by Reddit user Jake Dello ([/u/jakedello](https://www.reddit.com/u/jakedello)). The domain ([dmaorg.info](http://dmaorg.info)) linked to a 404 error page with the message:

import BrowserWindow from '@site/src/components/BrowserWindow';

<BrowserWindow url="http://dmaorg.info">
<h1>404 ER_ROR</h1>

Once you copy the violation code into the url, substituting the previous ||l_. symbol, you're able to enter the main dmaorg website: [http://dmaorg.info/found/15398642_14/clancy.html](https://www.dmaorg.site/original/found/15398642_14/clancy.html)

## 04/30/2018 - Vessel gif removed and added back

On April 30th, the Vessel gif featuring the link was removed from the store and then added back again on July 3rd, 2018.

Afterwards, with the release of TRENCH, the store website would undergo a complete redesign in which the current [Vessel collection tab](https://store.twentyonepilots.com/collections/vessel) no longer features any gifs on its page.
