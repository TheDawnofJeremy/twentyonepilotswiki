[![Alt text: Half tone image on white background showing a group of people standing at the top of a cliff. Perspective of the shot is like someone at the bottom of the cliff looking up at them. Same setting as the Jumpsuit music video.](./assets/2018_514_3_8.jpg)](./assets/2018_514_3_8.jpg)

**File name:** 2018_514_3_8.jpg

**Additional Info:**

- The picture has the following caption: __n_ot_myo_nly_fri_en d
- The file name 2018_514_3_8 translates to tr_en_c_h (1 = A, 2 = B, etc.)
- When you put “2018_514_3_8” into the url, substituting the violation code, you can access a new subdomain: [http://dmaorg.info/found/2018_514_3_8/clancy.html](https://www.dmaorg.site/062918/found/2018_514_3_8/clancy.html). It features an 8-second audio file with a distorted voice, which can be edited in order to hear Tyler’s voice. In the July 1st update, it was revealed that the voice says “We are banditos” but reversed.
- The audio link also worked with: [http://dmaorg.info/found/trench/clancy.html](https://www.dmaorg.site/062918/found/trench/clancy.html)
- The same reversed phrase from the audio is used on the Trench song “Nico and the Niners” at 3:31 - 3:34.
- A crosshair is visible near the middle of the image, blended into the half-tone shading of the rocks.
- It seems as there was an attempt to recreate the vulture picture (unnamed (1)), as when overlayed over each other, the positions of each figure match up pretty closely with the vultures.
