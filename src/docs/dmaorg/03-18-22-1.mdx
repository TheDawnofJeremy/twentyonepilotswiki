## 022 03MOON 18  - Day of the Update

Shortly after The Outside music video went live, dmaorg updated again adding this sketch of a weapon.
This weapon appears to be the anters from a Ned creature, which Clancy was able to use to control Keons.

**Additional Info:**

- In the top right, there is some textxt that when read top down, right to left, reads "SEIZE KEONS".
- The text seen near the center left is Greek, and reads ψυχή κίνησις, which translates to "psychí kínisis".
