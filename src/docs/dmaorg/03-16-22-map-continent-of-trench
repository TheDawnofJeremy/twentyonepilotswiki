On March 16th, 2022, dmaorg returned after almost a year of complete dormancy.  A crumpled black and white map was added, showing the entire continent of Trench, the walled off city of Dema, Port Vial on the coast of Dema, and the newly discovered island called Voldsoy-which is the Norwegian translation for "Violence Island". In the lower right corner, we can see the compass with East facing up
