## 022 03MOON 18  - Day of the Update

Shortly after The Outside music video went live, dmaorg updated again adding a sketch of a weapon together with a diagram of movements. 

[![Alt text: Drawn diagram of some sort of weapon, with scribbled notes at the bottom](./assets/w-eap-ø-n.jpg)](./assets/w-eap-ø-n.jpg)


**Transcription of the text seen throughout the drawing:**
> SEIZE KEONS
>
> υχή κίνησις
> 
> seize available vessel
> at Voldsøy eastern cove
> 
> glorious gone = available vessel
> 
> bishops control the available vessel!
> intercept and seize
>
> they will make you a weapon

** File name: ** w-eap-ø-n.jpg

**Additional Info:**

- In the top left, there is text that when read top down, right to left, reads "SEIZE KEONS".
- The text seen near the center left is Greek, and reads ψυχή κίνησις, which translates to "psychí kínisis". 
- The weapon shown in the picture are antlers from a Ned creature. When used while performing the outlined movements, Tyler was able to seize Keons as seen in the Outside music video.
