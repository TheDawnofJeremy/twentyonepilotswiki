## 01/07/21 to 03/31/21 - Twitter header desaturation

On January 7th, 2021, the band updated their Twitter, Youtube, and official website headers to an image that could be found earlier on in an AltPress interview magazine (#384). The photo was taken during a show of the Trench era. A bright red filter was initially applied over it, as well as the band’s yellow Trench logo.

The original image:

Starting on March 3rd at 2:53PM EST, the Twitter header started to desaturate consistently between one week intervals, progressively losing its original red color by 21% with each update. The yellow logo also began to fade:
