At around 2:40PM Eastern Time, the main dmaorg.info page reverted back to its original state before the website termination started, as if nothing ever happened to it. A new MOON date was added along with an image of a black map.

## 022 03MOON 16 - Day of the update

[![Alt text: Scan of a black map showcasing the aerial view of a coastal piece of land named “Continent of Trench”. A vast valley encased by a circular mountainous region covers the upper left center of the map; on the lower center, the Sacred Municipality of Dema can be seen; below it, a dot displays an area named “Port Vial” along the shoreside. A small island named “Voldsøy is displayed near the continent. The compass from the original DEMA map also appears in the lower right corner, but now with East pointing up.](./assets/v-o-lds-ø-y.jpg)](./assets/v-o-lds-ø-y.jpg)

**Additional Info:**

- A small island named Voldsøy is visible in the map, situated nearby the Continent of Trench. “Voldsøy” roughly translates to “violence island” in Norwegian.
- A [tweet](https://twitter.com/tylerrjoseph/status/1504217893336231950) from Tyler, posted in the same day of the update, along with a previous [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/Ca52_GVu_lI) suggests that Voldsøy is the “small, frigid island” where Tyler and Josh washed up.
- Unlike the previous [grey map](https://www.twentyonepilots.wiki/docs/trench/original-dmaorg-files#013-01moon-08) that first showcased the Sacred Municipality of Dema, this map's compass is already shifted to the correct orientation, with its East direction pointing up ("EAST IS UP").
- The striped, circular area that covers a large section of the map holds the same shape of the “Jumpsuit Medallion” symbol, discovered in the 2018 Bandito Immersive Experience by Spotify. It represents the valley of Trench.

[![Alt text: A black, ripped out page from a notepad displays the Jumpsuit Medallion symbol. Above it, a manuscript reads: “The atmosphere's perspective of the world we're lost in. This document of guidance, at times, feels like my only protection. Cover me.” Besides the page is the description of the symbol: “An aerial perspective of the world of Trench, this map helps us find our way as we face our journey alone. Amidst great solitude, this circular figure becomes our guide and our companion.](./assets/jumpsuit-medallion.jpg)](./assets/jumpsuit-medallion.jpg)

- Trivia: The day of this update marks 7 years since the start of the Blurryface era, prompted by the "Fairly Local" music video.
