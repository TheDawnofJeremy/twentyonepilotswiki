Following the release of the band's single 'Shy Away', the website https://live.twentyonepilots.com/  became available. It displayed a TV screen playing a speech of Josh explaining the "Livestream Experience". 
The website also included links to the merch store, and the possibility to buy tickets for the "Livestream experience" - an online concert on May 21st 2021. [^1]
