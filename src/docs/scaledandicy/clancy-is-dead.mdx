## 10/23/2020 - Clancy Is Dead

On October 23rd, 2020, physical copies of a USB flash drive were mailed to the first people who cracked the 20th code in the Level Of Concern Scavenger Hunt, which took place on June 12th of the same year. Inside the flash drive, a video named “tyler.mp4” could be found in which Tyler Joseph casually congratulates the viewer for finishing the hunt.

In the video’s background, a TV screen can be seen flashing multiple symbols. Translated with the symbol alphabet obtained in various other USB files across the scavenger hunt, the message spells out “CLANCY IS DEAD”, a reference to the character from the dmaorg.info lore.

## 04/02/2021 - Blurryface like

The BLURRYFACE twitter account was previously used during 2015-2016 by the band as an official outlet of cryptic tweets teasing their upcoming 2015 album Blurryface. On April 4th, 2016, the account posted its last tweet (now deleted):

After five years, on April 4th 2021 at 4:46PM EST, the same account liked a tweet - the second part of a thread by Twitter user @shlofolina, confirming the meaning of the “CLANCY IS DEAD” message hidden inside the flash drive video.

**Transcription of the full thread:**

> “no because everything makes sense now. 
> 
> - the emphasis on indoctrination throughout the LOC arg. Forcing people to believe a set of beliefs uncritically. We can assume this was part of Clancy’s smearing. 
> - Collection of Roses. Obvious
> - Clancy Is Dead on the TV in the flash drive. It was the announcement. A warning if you will.

> Now the termination of the website. The only answer is the bishops found out, tried to smear him and force him into dogmatic beliefs, and when he protested, vialism took place.”
